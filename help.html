        <h1>The Struggles: The French Revolution</h1>

        <p>Notice: All stats discussed in this manual assumes you are playing on BGS mode.</p>
        <p>WARNING: This game may not be completely historically accurate</p>
        
        <p>Basics</p>
        <h2>- The game works by turn, meaning you make descisions before you go on to the next. Every turn works by month. The goal of the game is to finish the revolution (as fast as possibe, if you aren't here to learn)</h2>
        <p>Survivng</p>
        <h2>- When playing, you have 4 character stats to take care of. To survive, we focus on 3. The 3 incude health, happiness and safety.</h2>
        <h2>- Health is gained and lost through the purchase of bread, monthly events and rioting. You lose 5 health for each bread less, and gain 5 for more. Bread does not carry on to the next month. If your health is too low, Robespierre will get infected and succumb to smallpox.</h2>
        <h2>- Happiness can be gained and lost through purchase of jewelery, in monthly and rioting. You lose 5 happiness by default every month. If your happiness is too low, Robespierre will die by suicide</h2>
        <h2>- Safety can ony be gained and lost by rioting and monthly events. Safety passively increases by 5 every month</h2>
        <h2>- If any stat drops below 10, you have a chance to die.</p>
        <p>Economy</p>
        <h2>- You gain your income amount every month. Bread at the start costs 13 sous, and jewelery 20 sous. You start with 250 sous a month.</h2>
        <h2>- Income and prices will fluctuate through inflation every month. However, regular shop prices will not be affected.</h2>
        <h2>- There are chances for prices and income to spike or drop significantly every month.</h2>
        <h2>- You can buy upgrades and instant stats from the shop.</h2>
        <h2>- Money can be obtained through monthly events, enforcement, and passively through income.</h2>
        <p>Progression</p>
        <h2>- You can gain popularity, the final character stat, through preaching, monthly events, the shop and rioting</h2>
        <h2>- Collecting popularity as fast as possible is the goal of the game. Reaching 4000 ends it.</h2>
        <h2>- Preaching is unlocked by default, and returns a random reward between money and popularity, Sometimes, you will fail and get punished instead.</h2>
        <h2>- Rioting is unlocked at 500 popularity. Rioting rewards 25 popularity in return for 10 of a stat or 50 sous. </h2>
        <h2>- Enforcement is unlocked. If you need emergency money, you can convert popularity to sous at 0.5popularity/sous</h2>
        <p>Gameplay</p>
        <h2>- There are 4 difficulties: Scholar, Noble, BGS (short for bourgeoisie) and Peasant. Scholar is for learning purposes, Noble is easy, BGS is medium, Peasant is hard.</h2>
        <h2>- You cannot die in Scholar and all events happen during their canon date.</h2>
        <h2>- You only have a stat loss of 3 in Noble, and there is no chance to die cutoff.</h2>
        <h2>- You lose 5 stats in BGS, and the cutoff is 10 for death chance.</h2>
        <h2>- You lose 7 stats in Peasant, and 25 is the cutoff for the death chance.</h2>
